# CS 305 Module 5 Example Repository

The following text describes a project not located in this reposititory and is unrelated. It is included in this file for the sake of an example.

The Better Bricks mod is a Minecraft mod developed for Minecraft versions 1.12.2, 1.16.5, and 1.18.2.

The Better Bricks mod adds new brick types and recipes to your Minecraft world.

While there are quite a few mods that simply add colored bricks to Minecraft, I have found very few that add bricks that are useful in building in modern and contemporary styles.

That is why I decided to create the Better Bricks mod.

Currently this mod adds 9 new types of brick to your Minecraft world.

In addition, this mod adds mortar, a new substance made with clay, sand, and coal. Mortar is needed to craft the various bricks.
